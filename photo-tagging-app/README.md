# photo-tagging-app
This project focused on implementing a backend as a service and let me practice setting up and hosting a project on firebase.
Users are times in finding the 4 characters (Waldo, wizard, Odlaw, and Wendy) and will get feedback if the character is not found.
Afterwards they are given there score and are able to submit to see if they are able to make the leaderboard.
This was an enjoyable project, and introduced me into the back-end concept and being able to pull and save data back and forth
into my projects.
